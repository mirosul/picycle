Software
-------

1. Generate pulse
    - 10 ticks / second)

2. Read the KML / GPX
    - KML for now

3. Smooth the KML / GPX
    - have a point every 10m
    - find a way to get a point every 5 meters

4. Read the ticks

5. Calculate the current distance
    - based on the ticks number and the ticks/meter ratio

6. Calculate the current latitude/longitude

6.1 Calculate orientation angle

6.2 Pull StreetView image

6.3 Display StreetView image

7. Calculate slope
